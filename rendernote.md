You know, I'm not sure I get how Console and Window are different, now that I
realize you can blit a Console to the root console. Because Consoles aren't
actually separate rendered consoles like I thought. They're objects that can be
drawn to and then blitted onto the root console at certain coordinates.

I guess Console can be used to render to any part of the screen, whereas a
Window is fixed to a certain part of the screen. I suppose that's something.

Also, the color (100, 147, 100) is a nice tundra-grass-ish color. I might want
to use that for something.
