# Eldritch Estate
(TODO: write description.)

## Running
### Linux
```
$ python3 setup.py install
$ eldestrl
```

### Windows
(TODO: make it easier and then write this section.)

## Development
Eldritch Estate is written to run on Python 3 -- originally Python 3.4 and
currently Python 3.5. Windows support is a work in progress: it should run, but
requires that you have a compiler installed that is compatible with your version
of Python. (If you've just downloaded Python 3.5 from the Python Foundation
website, that means Visual C++ 2015. This is not installed automatically with
Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition; see
[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/60k1461a.aspx](this page) for
details.)
