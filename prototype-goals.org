* Complete a prototype of the eldritch real estate game. [1/7]
  Remember: don't write anything extra, and no more content than is absolutely
  necessary. We're trying to actually finish this thing.
** DONE Code the map representation.
   CLOSED: [2015-08-07 Fri 18:07]
   It's not ideal, but I think it's essentially as I need it for a prototype.
   I'll have to rethink it and rewrite it at some later point if I go on to
   realize the game proper, though.
** TODO Write the pseudorandom content generation system
   It only needs to work for maps right now, but I may later want to extend it to
   clients, items, monsters, plots, or whatever. But it really only needs to work
   for maps at the moment, so that's what I'll code it for.
** TODO Write the lighting system.
   I'm not really sure how to start with this.
** TODO Code the Fog of Fh'tagn system.
** TODO Write the Line of Sight system.
   Really, this means "integrate libtcod/UnTDL's line of sight system." Same
   difference, until and unless I learn how to implement one myself -- and I
   might, but I'll probably still use the library version even so. It's written
   in C by someone other than me, so it's likely to be faster.
** TODO Code up some very basic NPCs.
   These two could probably share some basic code with each other and/or the
   player's internal representation.  I should try and make sure they do somehow.
*** DONE Write player/general NPC/actor code.

    Actually, I did this earlier, technically, but I forgot to tick it off. Oh,
    well.
*** DONE Code the real estate clients.
    CLOSED: [2015-08-07 Fri 18:06]
    They work, and with a minimum of bugs fixed. Success!
*** TODO Program the monsters' existence/behavior.
** TODO Write the UI code.
