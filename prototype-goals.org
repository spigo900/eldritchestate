* Complete a prototype of the eldritch real estate game. [0/7]
  Remember: don't write anything extra, and no more content than is absolutely
  necessary. We're trying to actually finish this thing.
** TODO Code the map representation.
** TODO Write the pseudorandom content generation system
   It only needs to work for maps right now, but I may later want to extend it to
   clients, items, monsters, plots, or whatever. But it really only needs to work
   for maps at the moment, so that's what I'll code it for.
** TODO Write the lighting system.
** TODO Code the Fog of Fh'tagn system.
** TODO Write the Line of Sight system.
** TODO Code up some very basic NPCs.
   These two could probably share some basic code with each other and/or the
   player's internal representation.  I should try and make sure they do somehow.
*** TODO Write player/general NPC/actor code.
*** TODO Code the real estate clients.
*** TODO Program the monsters' existence/behavior.
** TODO Write the UI code.
